        <h2>A bit about me</h2>

            <p>I'm a sophomore and Games and Interactive Media student here at MSU! I was previously doing Computer Science before switching here. I'm excited to continue learning about game development and the various tools involved.</p>

        <h2>Horror Media</h2>

            <h3>Games and Movies</h3>

            <p>I'm a big horror media fan, from stories, movies, shows, and games. I was first introduced to horror when I was extremely young, maybe too young. My dad and I would watch old movies, like the original Wolf Man, and play old horror games.</p>
